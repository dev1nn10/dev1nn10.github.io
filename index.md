# My CPSC120 Lab Portfolio

* Lab 4 Part  1
	
I chose this lab to reflect on based on the nature of how I was curious on how  conversions worked. The one important thing I learned about this lab especially in part 1 is declaring a double variable. But also, I learned the conversion units and what to divide by to get those units. I was able to write functions to enter a value and get multiple outputs for different units of conversion.

* Lab 5 Part 2
	
I chose this lab as another one of my favorites to reflect on because this lab introduced us to if statements. The if statements used in this part were to convert units of feet to feet-inches. I learned how to write my if-statements more efficiently and to declare both int and double variables. This part also included conversions which also taught me how to convert feet to feet-inches myself. 


* Lab 10 Part 1

This lab in particular was one I did enjoy coding and learning about for loops. The previous labs may have included for loops but this one in particular helped me grasp for loops much better. I learned to use for loops in the counties_functions.cc page and to also convert strings to integers using the std::stoi command. The for loops in this lab used constant which is something new I also learned.
